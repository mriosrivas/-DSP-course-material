    "# Understanding the FFT Algorithm\n",

    "<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->\n",
    "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important algorithms in signal processing and data analysis. I've used it for years, but having no formal computer science background, It occurred to me this week that I've never thought to ask *how* the FFT computes the discrete Fourier transform so quickly.  I dusted off an old algorithms book and looked into it, and enjoyed reading about the deceptively simple computational trick that JW Cooley and John Tukey outlined in their classic [1965 paper](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1965-19-090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1/) introducing the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this post is to dive into the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, explaining the symmetries that lead to it, and to show some straightforward Python implementations putting the theory into practice.  My hope is that this exploration will give data scientists like myself a more complete picture of what's going on in the background of the algorithms we use.\n",

    "## The Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The FFT is a fast, $\\mathcal{O}[N\\log N]$ algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which\n",
    "naively is an $\\mathcal{O}[N^2]$ computation.  The DFT, like the more familiar continuous version of the Fourier transform, has a forward and inverse form which are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):**\n",
    "$$X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-i~2\\pi~k~n~/~N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT):**\n",
    "$$x_n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k e^{i~2\\pi~k~n~/~N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation from $x_n \\to X_k$ is a translation from configuration space to frequency space, and can be very useful in both exploring the power spectrum of a signal, and also for transforming certain problems for more efficient computation.  For some examples of this in action, you can check out Chapter 10 of our upcoming Astronomy/Statistics book, with figures and Python source code available [here](http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/chapter10/).  For an example of the FFT being used to simplify an otherwise difficult differential equation integration, see my post on [Solving the Schrodinger Equation in Python](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the importance of the FFT in so many fields, Python contains many standard tools and wrappers to compute this.  Both NumPy and SciPy have wrappers of the extremely well-tested FFTPACK library, found in the submodules ``numpy.fft`` and ``scipy.fftpack`` respectively.  The fastest FFT I am aware of is in the [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) package, which is also available in Python via the [PyFFTW](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFFTW) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment, though, let's leave these implementations aside and ask how we might compute the FFT in Python from scratch.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing the Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we'll concern ourself only with the forward transform, as the inverse transform can be implemented in a very similar manner.  Taking a look at the DFT expression above, we see that it is nothing more than a straightforward linear operation: a matrix-vector multiplication of $\\vec{x}$,\n",

    "We've improved our implementation by another order of magnitude!  We're now within about a factor of 10 of the FFTPACK benchmark, using only a couple dozen lines of pure Python + NumPy.  Though it's still no match computationally speaking, readibility-wise the Python version is far superior to the FFTPACK source, which you can browse [here](http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/fft.c).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does FFTPACK attain this last bit of speedup?  Well, mainly it's just a matter of detailed bookkeeping.  FFTPACK spends a lot of time making sure to reuse any sub-computation that can be reused.  Our numpy version still involves an excess of memory allocation and copying; in a low-level language like Fortran it's easier to control and minimize memory use.  In addition, the Cooley-Tukey algorithm can be extended to use splits of size other than 2 (what we've implemented here is known as the *radix-2* Cooley-Tukey FFT).  Also, other more sophisticated FFT algorithms may be used, including fundamentally distinct approaches based on convolutions (see, e.g. Bluestein's algorithm and Rader's algorithm).  The combination of the above extensions and techniques can lead to very fast FFTs even on arrays whose size is not a power of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the pure-Python functions are probably not useful in practice, I hope they've provided a bit of an intuition into what's going on in the background of FFT-based data analysis.  As data scientists, we can make-do with black-box implementations of fundamental tools constructed by our more algorithmically-minded colleagues, but I am a firm believer that the more understanding we have about the low-level algorithms we're applying to our data, the better practitioners we'll be."
